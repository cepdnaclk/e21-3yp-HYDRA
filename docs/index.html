## Introduction

### The Real-World Problem
Urban congestion is one of the defining challenges of modern cities. Traditional traffic control systems rely on **static, fixed-timer logic** that is blind to real-world conditions. A traffic light stays red even when the road is empty, while kilometers of cars sit idling on the cross-street.

Furthermore, standard systems fail to account for **environmental factors** and **vehicle classification**. Heavy vehicles take longer to accelerate, and wet roads increase braking distances, yet traffic lights treat every vehicle and every weather condition exactly the same.

### The Solution
**HYDRA (HYbrid Dynamic Realtime Automation)** is an intelligent, adaptive traffic management system designed to replace static timers with **dynamic, sensor-driven logic**.

HYDRA transforms isolated intersections into a **connected neural network**. By utilizing a "Green Wave" algorithm, it coordinates multiple intersections to allow platoons of vehicles to pass through without stopping. The system uniquely integrates **heavy vehicle detection** and **rain sensors** to adjust safety margins.

For the prototype demonstration, HYDRA implements a **fully automated kinetic model** using a **gravity-fed servo-barrier mechanism** to physically drive vehicle queues automatically when the light turns green.

## Solution Architecture

### High-Level Overview
HYDRA follows a **Centralized-Edge Topology** to ensure synchronized decision-making:

* **The Physical Layer (Kinetic Model)**: Dual-intersection road network with 4 paths each using gravity-assist drive and servo barriers.
* **Edge Node Layer (The Limbs)**: ESP32 Microcontrollers handling localized sensor processing (IR, Ultrasonic, Piezo, Rain).
* **Central Intelligence Layer (The Brain)**: Raspberry Pi / MQTT Broker running the "Green Wave" algorithm.

## Testing

### Functionality Testing
* **The "Green Wave" Test:** Verifying that a platoon released from Intersection A arrives at Intersection B exactly as the light turns Green.
* **Heavy Vehicle Override:** Dropping a weighted model car over the Piezo sensor to trigger extended Green time.
* **Safety Mode:** Spraying water on the Rain Sensor to verify the automatic increase in Yellow Light duration.
* **Kinetic Mechanism:** Ensuring Servo Barriers hold traffic at Red and release smoothly at Green.
